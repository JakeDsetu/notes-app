# notes-app
A Console-based Notes App written using Kotlin.

## Overview
This app allows users to create and store written notes. These notes can then be deleted and edited at will. It uses simple console navigation.
Users can then use these notes for their own purposes. E.g. shopping lists, reminder notes, taking down info, etc.

## Getting Started
This app currently runs through source code. You can open an IDE (such as IntelliJ) and run the app in its console emulator.
